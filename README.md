This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of "k-t CLAIR: Self-Consistency Guided Multi-Prior Learning for Dynamic Parallel MR Image Reconstruction" ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11050), [supp](https://github.com/lpzhang/ktCLAIR/releases), [pretrained models](https://github.com/lpzhang/ktCLAIR/releases), [visual results](https://github.com/lpzhang/ktCLAIR/releases), [oral presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VVPB1IN0n8)). k-t CLAIR achieves **state-of-the-art performance** in
- accelerated Cine reconstruction
- accelerated T1/T2 mapping

</br>

## Updates
- [2023/10/12] 🥉 We secured 3rd place in accelerated Cine reconstruction task in [CMRxRecon Challenge](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn51471091/wiki/624102) during MICCAI 2023!
- [2023/10/12] 🥉 We secured 3rd place in accelerated T1/T2 Mapping task in [CMRxRecon Challenge](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn51471091/wiki/624102) during MICCAI 2023!
- [2023/10/12] 🔥 Invited talk for CMRxRecon Challenge, [Statistical Atlases and Computational Modeling of the Heart (STACOM) Workshop](https://stacom.github.io/stacom2023/), MICCAI 2023 (Vancouver, Canada)!
